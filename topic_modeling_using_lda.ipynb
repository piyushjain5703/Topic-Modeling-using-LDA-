              "42027    after many weeks of receiving hourly phone calls from navient i sent them a letter instructing them only to contact me by mail per the fair debt collection practices act and the calls stopped although they have emailed me a couple of times today xx/xx/19 the mother of a friend from middle school let me know that navient had called her and left a message for me she is not listed as an emergency or secondary contact in any of my paperwork ; navient should not have her number unless they dig it up themselves this is a huge breach of privacy and a clear violation of the fdcpa given that i had instructed them to only contact me by phone and that they contacted someone completely unrelated to me and told them they were looking for me regarding student loan debt per the fdcpa : \" a debt collector may not communicate in connection with the collection of any debt with any person other than the consumer his attorney a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law the creditor the attorney of the creditor or the attorney of the debt collector '' navient clearly violated this \\n\\nthe person who contacted her was named xxxx xxxx and she gave the reference number xxxx and the phone number xxxx extension xxxx                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
              "13307    as a former customer of xxxx i swithced my services to another carrier as of xx/xx/2018 after experiencing a period of two weeks in which time we had no service this was due to a global technical issue however we were not able to make and or receive calls prior to leaving xxxx i did reach out to tech support both via phone and via the app on the phone time and time again with an attempt to get this issue resolved however i was not able too even though we did not have service xxxx was not forgiving the bill in any way shape or form and i had an infant therefore it was and is important that i have a cell phone that works in case of an emergency finally after getting no place i took my business else where \\n\\na few days later after switching my cell phone provider without even contacting xxxx i received a return kit in the mail so that i could return the two devices xxxx to them using the prepaid return label via xxxx this was exactly what did during this time we were in the processing of moving therefore i misplaced the return tracking number however working in customer care and with return label i am fully aware that as a company they have the means to locate the return tracking # and track the return package if they wanted too \\n\\nagain call after call i got no place on xxxx day xx/xx/2018 i received notification from at least 3 cards one being my bank card that xxxx illegally tried to charge each of the cards {$180000} \\n\\nthis was an issue and i flipped from the beginning as i never authorized xxxx to keep any card i ever used to pay a bill with on file each time i paid a bill via the ivr and was asked if i wanted my information kept on file i responded no furthermore the amount was incorrect \\n\\nworking in the xxxx industry full time there is nothing slow about me i am fully aware that is illegal to keep a customers credit card and or banking information on file and charge it for any amount with out their consent on the same day after notifying my card issuers i did not make this purchase and i did not authorize it to have all my cards cancelled and new ones issued i contacted xxxx yet again \\n\\ni spoke with a nice rep who was only able to assist me to a limited amount she advised me she would note the account accordingly and have the phones returned located at this point my account should have been placed on hold and it was not \\n\\ni continued to climb the corporate ladder and went to the executive office originally i was dealing with xxxx xxxx who was useless she admitted xxxx did keep my information on file and that it was okay for them to charge my cards as a letter was sent to me advising it would be done i never got this letter to begin with and it is not okay as i never authorized xxxx to keep my information on file \\n\\nshe was not willing to help we had a few words and i started working with xxxx xxxx again we went back and forth and originally he too did not want to assist me in locating the phones i told him what xxxx did is fraud even cc executive leadership on each email sent to xxxx and xxxx though it got me no place finally after the 120 days passsed ( this is the length of time xxxx keeps the return tracking information in there system for ) i was told that as a courtesy he lowered my bill to {$47000} \\n\\ni requested that the account me removed from my credit immediately and xxxx continued to refuse even though they committed fraud and they are to blame i agreed to make a payment which i did never committed to an amount and still they would not remove it from my credit \\n\\nxxxx has changed their collection companies time and time again just to keep this invalid debit active \\n\\ni have continued to research my rights and have even sent xxxx a demand letter requesting {$300000} ; in court i can get 3 times the amount if it is found in my favor and clearly with xxxx illegally keeping and attempting to charge several of my cards with out my consent they clearly committed fraud \\n\\ni went back and forth with the collection companies and finally reached a really nice rep several months ago at sunrise when i explained the above in detail to her she did confirm what xxxx did was fraud and that she would put my account on hold while i appreciate her help this is not good enough \\n\\ni want this removed from my credit for over a year xxxx the collection companies and their illegal practices have ruined my credit beyond belief \\n\\ni pay all my bills on time and xxxx  carelessness and fraudlent activity as destroyed my credit \\n\\ni am not able to get any new cards no loans and or refinance my car \\n\\nthis is not acceptable and i would like this removed from my credit immediately and {$300000} for all that they have put me thru \\n\\nthank you\n",
